# Openplanet Remote Build Tasks Extension

This is an extension for Visual Studio Code which adds custom tasks that can compile your plugins for the
[Openplanet](https://openplanet.dev/) extension platform for the video games Trackmania and Maniaplanet.

[Remote Build](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/remotebuild) is a plugin for the Openplanet platform which listens for
commands on a TCP socket and triggers plugin compilation.

In order to perform plugin builds using this extension you will also need to have the Remote Build plugin loaded into
Openplanet.
